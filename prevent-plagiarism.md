# How to prevent (and detect) plagiarism

## Use the plagiarism detector in Canvas
All courses have their own Canvas page, where you can share information and set up assignments. When setting up an assignment, make sure you turn on the Turnitin plagiarism check. To do this:

1. Create an assignment
2. In the Submission Type dialog, use the dropdown menu to select 'Online'
3. Check the box 'File upload'
4. A new dialog appears below, named Plagarism Review
5. Use the dropdown in this new dialog and select Turnitin.

Some additional remarks:

* The Canvas plugin does not automatically compare submissions against journals, but you can activate this by checking the appropriate box in the Plagiarism Review dialog. This is necessary for all courses taught within MBCS.
* You can choose whether and when the students can also see the plagiarism check. We recommend displaying this to students after the assignment is graded.

## Understand the root causes of plagiarism
Plagiarism appears to be the easy way out, and so we assume students who plagiarize do it because they are too lazy to put in the actual effort. While such cases do exist, perfectionism or self-doubt can also bring students to copy materials, as can (perceived) outside pressure to perform exceedingly well. Unfortunately for MBCS, such sentiments are the flipside of a selective research master

By providing students with early, constructive feedback on their performance, you may be able reduce some of the anxiety that students can feel, and this can in turn help prevent instances of plagiarism.
