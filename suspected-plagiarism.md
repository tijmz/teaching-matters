# What is plagiarism?

At the Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies (IIS), we follow the definitions of plagiarism as given in [Regulations Governing Fraud and Plagiarism for UvA Students](https://student.uva.nl/binaries/content/assets/studentensites/uva-studentensite/nl/a-z/regelingen-en-reglementen/regulations-governing-fraud-and-plagiarism.pdf). Within MBCS, we expect our course coordinators to follow [best practices to prevent plagiarism](prevent-plagiarism.md).

# Why this manual?

Although plagiarism is clearly defined, any sanctions proposed by the Examinations Board should take mitigating or aggravating factors into account. These may include the status of the submitted work (i.e. draft or final version), the relation between the plagiarized material and the respective assignment, whether the plagiarism is a repeat offense, etc.. This manual aims to structure such considerations, so that:

1.  It is easy for an examiner who suspects plagiarism to assess the potential seriousness of the offense and to submit a clear suspicion to the Examinations Board.
2.  It is clear to the Examinations Board how to assess the seriousness of an offense and which sanctions can be applied.

Ultimately, the IIS decided that there are four possible categories of seriousness with corresponding sanctions. 

| **Category**           |                                  **Options for sanctions (cumulative)**                                 |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------: |
| Acceptable negligence  |Warn student, subtract up to 1 grade point, note in student file                   |
| Poor academic practice |Subtract more than 1 grade point, declare assessment void                       |
| Serious offense        |Retract the student right to resit                                  |
| Very serious offense   |Exclude student from course, exclude the student from assessment in the programme for up to 12 months |

In case of repeat offense, the Examinations Board may decide on sanctions typical of a more serious offense. Similarly, the Examinations Board may decide to not impose the heaviest sanctions (e.g. a very serious offense may not lead to exclusion from assessment within the programme). 

# How do I choose the category of the suspected plagiarism?

You can determine the category of suspected plagiarism through three steps:

1. Selecting the type of suspected plagiarism.
2. In the corresponding type rubric, find the description most similar to your case.
3. Read off from the rubric which category applies.

Once you have done this, you can submit the case to the Examinations Board.
